## 💤 Statistical Analysis of Sleep Health & Lifestyle  

### 📌 Overview  
This project explores the relationship between **sleep quality, duration, and lifestyle factors** using statistical methods. The goal is to uncover patterns in sleep health based on gender, BMI, stress levels, physical activity, and step count.  

### 📊 Statistical Analyses  

1. **Is sleep quality different for males and females?**  
   - **Method:** Two-sample t-test  
   - **Response Variable:** Quality of Sleep  
   - **Predictor Variable:** Gender  

2. **Does sleep duration vary across BMI categories?**  
   - **Method:** One-way ANOVA  
   - **Response Variable:** Sleep Duration  
   - **Predictor Variable:** BMI Category (Underweight, Normal, Overweight)  

3. **Is sleep quality affected by stress levels?**  
   - **Method:** Simple Linear Regression  
   - **Response Variable:** Quality of Sleep  
   - **Predictor Variable:** Stress Level  

4. **How do physical activity and step count impact sleep duration?**  
   - **Method:** Multiple Linear Regression  
   - **Response Variable:** Sleep Duration  
   - **Predictor Variables:** Physical Activity, Daily Steps  

### 🛠️ Tools & Libraries 
- **JMP Software**
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels)  
- **Jupyter Notebook**
